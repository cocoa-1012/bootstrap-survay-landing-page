	- we've used the bootstrap and survey-jquery for this project.
	   o Bootstrap
		* Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
		* Bootstrap 4 is the newest version of Bootstrap.
	 	* This provides the grids automatically, so we can apply them as the types "col-lg-*, col-md-*, col-sm-*". this helps us to make mobile-friendly responsive.
	   o Survey-jquery
		* survey.js is a JavaScript Survey Library. It is a modern way to add a survey to our website. It uses JSON for survey metadata and results.
		{landingpage.html 62 - 141 lines}
		* We can find the example code at following links https://surveyjs.io/Examples/Library
		* We had to customized the survey-jquery.css so that we can get the favorite design.
		  . 1) find the element's id or class name from the Inspect on your browser (for example class="sv-body__progress" or id="sq_105_ariaTitle")
		  . 2) download the link("https://unpkg.com/survey-jquery@1.8.36/modern.css") and find the same name.
		  . 3) replace or change the css content so that it makes your favorite design. (*.*)
		* I've made a custom css file (survey-jquery-modern.css) so that you can understand it easily.
	- mobile responsive
	  o (max-width: 992px) 
	  o (max-width: 576px)
	  o (max-width: 576px)
		you can see the change in displaying when the browser width has changed.
	- CSS
	   o you can see the "!important" in the index.css
		* important property in CSS is used to provide more weight (importance) than normal property. In CSS, the ! important means that “this is important”, ignore all the subsequent rules, and apply ! important rule and the !
		* Since we use the bootstrap CSS and survey-jquery CSS for this project, there are a lot of default properties. So we had to use the "!important" so that our custom css works well there.
